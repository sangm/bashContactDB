This project was done as an introduction to the bash scripting language.
This was my first time doing bash, so I am sure there are errors, however, I 
have spent much time researching what is the considered to be the "best"
way to program in bash.

* List of Bash Features that I used
    * Associative Arrays
    * Regex Comparison
    * String Replacement

* List People
    * Using tput to list colors and underline in terminal

* Query People
    * Using pipes to separate query fields and use getopt to parse different options
